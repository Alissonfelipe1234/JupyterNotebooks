An exploratory pilot survey conducted in 2015 with the key stakeholders namely the Communications Regulatory Authority; Internet Service Providers and government departments revealed that these standards are not being implemented at all. Based on literature review and the preliminary surveys; this paper presents the extent to which the ISO/IEC 27000 implementation framework is adopted in Namibia. The study will focus on the implementation extent for ISO 27000; 27001; 27002; 27003 and 27004 as these are the critical standards to the security posture of any organisation. A qualitative case study research approach with security critical organisations in Namibia was used for this study. Surveys and interviews were used to collect data from purposefully identified key stakeholders. The stakeholders offered rich information about the phenomenon under study. The survey results were used to evaluate the extent of implementation and the factors contributing to the poor implementation. A theoretical framework was derived from the findings and is thus presented in this paper. The factors making up the theoretical framework will be used as a basis in designing a policy framework for the adoption of security standards by organisations in Namibia to secure its critical assets; manage risks more effectively; improve and maintain customer confidence; demonstrate conformance to international best practice; avoid brand damage and change its InformationSecurity  posture as the technology is evolving.

For the purpose of examining research trends   in the area of multimedia security; a network analysis was conducted   focusing on keywords to understand the correlation among studies by   analyzing well-known academic journals and identifying the directional   nature of research. Based on the keywords researched; a meta-analysis   was conducted. The result showed that the highest frequency keyword was   `certification and keywords formed correlations affecting research   trends.

The purpose of this paper is to propose a dual-sided business data integrity policy framework. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a review of the available literature; case studies; and in-depth interviews with top CEOs and experts in the field; a fuzzy Delphi method is proposed in two frameworks. In addition; a risk evaluation rule is derived by applying Bayesian decision analysis to mitigate the risk and lower the cost in their outsourcing policy; and Delphi method is used to extract 11 DC service quality evaluation indicators and also use these indicators to conduct a benchmark in Taiwan. Furthermore; the proposed framework is applied to figure out critical service advantages as well as suggestions for the DC involved in the benchmark. Findings: The results of framework point out that enterprises should monitor the four operation elements (facility and infrastructure; server system management; ISM ; and disaster recovery (DR) mechanism) to ensure and improve their data integrity; and DC firms need to build robust facilities and services in the five operation elements (customizability; serviceability;   informationTechnology  infrastructure; security management; and knowledge intensity). Originality/value: This paper uses a hybrid Delphi-Bayesian method to propose a new framework; which is adequately integrated with the consensus of experts and business decision makers; higher professionalism and content validity are achieved. Enterprises can use these indicators to evaluate the service quality of DCs among DC firms.',2010,'2018-11-29 12:52:51','2018-11-29 12:52:51',,'800–824',,5,39,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,'Decision making; Risk management; Data security; Cybernetics; Delphi method; Fuzzy logic',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A conceptual security framework to manage and audit Information System Security is proposed and discussed. The proposed framework intends to assist organizations firstly to understand what they precisely need to protect assets and what are their weaknesses (vulnerabilities); enabling to perform an adequate security management. Secondly; enabling a security audit framework to support the organization to assess the efficiency of the controls and policy adopted to prevent or mitigate attacks; threats and vulnerabilities; promoted by the advances of new technologies and new Internet-enabled services; that the organizations are subject of.

The model proposed within the paper aims to holistically consider all the security dimension. This is because the security level is as strong as the weakest link is. In order to minimize the likelihood that a given threat takes advantage of the weakest link a formalized structure taking into account all security elements is needed. The proposed model is based on and integrates some security best practices and standards in order to define an assured InformationSecurity  Categorization.

A review of ISRM literature identified deficiencies in the practice of InformationSecurity  risk assessment that inevitably lead to poor decision-making and inadequate or inappropriate security strategies. In this conceptual paper; we propose a situation aware ISRM (SA-ISRM) process model to complement the InformationSecurity  risk management process. Our argument is that the model addresses the aforementioned deficiencies through an enterprise-wide collection; analysis and reporting of risk-related information. The SA-ISRM model is adapted from Endsleys situation awareness model and has been refined using our findings from a case study of the US national security intelligence enterprise.

However; protection of information assets has to be taken two factors into account-time and cost. In other words; when it comes to risk assessment; an overall protection without discriminating different security levels of the information asset is not only cost-ineffective but also impossible in practice. Only by dividing information assets into different security levels and deciding which security measure fits the security needs can we have rational risk assessment for information assets. Banking industry is apparently not exceptional to this line of thinking. Nevertheless; most research reports on risk assessment of information assets of the banking industry are rarely made to the public as a result of security policy of its financial sectors. This paper selects one of Taiwanese major bank as a starting point and seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of its security measure by dividing its information assets into different security levels. Methodologically; the Delphi method is adopted by the paper and the questionnaires are designed based on the guidelines of ISM  of BS 7799-1: 2000; BS 7799-2: 2002 and ISO/IEC TR 13335. The paper chooses 99 information assets that are subject to security concern as targets for risk assessment; and has 7 experts in InformationSecurity  and computer auditing answer the questionnaires with respect to current value of the assets; possible threats; vulnerability and degree of risks. Risks are presented as low; medium and high ranging over 9 degrees on risk scale. The paper reports the results that there is one item that reaches medium-level risk while others stay at the low-level area and it also suggests that enhancing security measures for all assets may end up with risk degree greater or equal to 2.

Internet of things has gained extensive attention; the deployment of sensors; actuators are increasing at a rapid pace around the world. There is tremendous scope for more streamlined living through an increase of smart services; but this coincides with an increase in security and privacy concerns. There is a need to perform a systematic review of InformationSecurity  governance frameworks in the Internet of things (IoT). Objective - The aim of this paper to evaluate systematic review of ISM  frameworks which are related to the Internet of things (IoT). It will also discuss different InformationSecurity  frameworks that cover IoT models and deployments across different verticals. These frameworks are classified according to the area of the framework; the security executives and senior management of any enterprise that plans to start using smart services needs to define a clear governance strategy concerning the security of their assets; this system review will help them to make a better decision for their investment for secure IoT deployments. Method - A set of standard criteria has been established to analyze which security framework will be the best fit among these classified security structures in particularly for Internet of Things (IoT). The first step to evaluate security framework by using standard criteria methodology is to identify resources; the security framework for IoT is selected to be assessed according to CCS. The second step is to develop a set of Security Targets (ST). The ST is the set of criteria to apply for the target of evaluation (TOE). The third step is data extraction; fourth step data synthesis; and final step is to write-up study as a report. Conclusion - After reviewing four InformationSecurity  risk frameworks; this study makes some suggestions related to InformationSecurity  risk governance in Internet of Things (IoT). The organizations that have decided to move to smart devices have to define the benefits and risks and deployment processes to manage security risk. The InformationSecurity  risk policies should comply with an organizations InformationTechnology policies and standards to protect the confidentiality; integrity and availability of InformationSecurity . The study observes some of the main processes that are needed to manage security risks. Moreover; the paper also drew attention on some suggestions that may assist companies which are associated with the InformationSecurity  framework in Internet of things (IoT).',2016,'2018-11-29 12:53:10','2018-11-29 12:53:10',,'1270–1275',,,,,,,,,,,'IEEE; IEEE Comp Soc; IEEE Tech Comm Scalable Comp; Univ Technol Sydney',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,'Chen; J and Yang; LT',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Purpose: An action is utilitarian when it is both useful and practical. This paper aims to examine a number of traditional ISM  practices to ascertain their utility. That analysis is performed according to the particular set of challenges and requirements experienced by very large organizations. Examples of such organizations include multinational corporations; the governments of large nations and global investment banks. Design/methodology/approach: The author performs a gap analysis of a number of security management practices. The examination is focused on the question of whether these practices are both useful and practical when used within very large organizations. Findings: The author identifies a number of ISM  practices that are considered to be “best practice” in the general case but that are suboptimal at the margin represented by very large organizations. A number of alternative management practices are proposed that compensate for the identified weaknesses. Originality/value: Quoting from the conclusion of the paper: We have seen in our analysis within this paper that some best practices can experience what economists refer to as diminishing marginal utility. As the target organization drifts from the typical use-case the amount of value-added declines and can potentially enter negative territory. We have also examined the degree of innovation in the practice of security management and the extent to which the literature can support practical; real-world activities.

These methods are usually used to compare all alternatives based on the synthesized scorings within a normalized scale with respect to the same criteria in multicriteria problems. However; the decision makers often simultaneously manage one or several alternatives/projects with conflicting and noncommensurable criteria to reduce the gaps to achieve the aspired grade in practice. They then need to rank the gaps that have not been reduced or improved (the unimproved gaps) for the alternatives/projects or aspects of a project to get the most benefit. Because these compared alternatives/projects do not usually have the same criteria/aspects; traditional methods are unsuitable to deal with them. Thus; this research proposes a new VIKOR method to solve this problem; this new method allows the decision maker to understand these gaps of the projects/aspects and rank them to improve these large gaps in control items to achieve the aspired level. Its concept originates in compromise solutions; in particular the VIKOR method. In addition; this research also provides an example of improving InformationSecurity  risk to demonstrate the suitability of this new method.

Many questions remain; for example; about appropriate levels of detail and abstraction that enable different organisations to learn from incidents that occur in other companies within the same or different industries. The Generic Security Template has been proposed; aiming to provide a unified way to share the lessons learned from real world security incidents. In particular; it adapts the graphical Goal Structuring Notation (GSN); to present lessons learned in a structured manner by mapping them to the security requirements of the ISMS. In this paper; we have shown how a Generic Security Template can be used to structure graphical overviews of specific incidents. We have also shown the template can be instantiated to communicate the findings from an investigation into the US VA data breach. Moreover; this paper has empirically evaluated this approach to the creation of a Generic Security Template; this provides users with an overview of the lessons derived from security incidents at a level of abstraction that can help to implement recommendations in future contexts that are different from those in which an attack originally took place.',2014,'2018-11-29 12:53:23','2018-11-29 12:53:23',,'178–188',,,,,,,'International Conference on Computer Science and   informationTechnology ',,,,'Appl Sci Pvt Univ; Fac Informat Technol',,,,,,,,,,,,,'Generic Security Template; Goal Structuring Notation; lessons learned; security incident',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To realize such support tools; a database system that manages ISO/IEC 27000 series; which are international standards for  ISM ; and ISMS documents; which are the products of tasks in ISMS lifecycle processes; is indispensable. The database system should manage data of the standards and documents for all available versions and translations; relationship among the standards and documents; authorization to access the standards and documents; and metadata of the standards and documents. No such database system has existed until now. This paper presents an ISM  database system (ISMDS) that manages ISO/IEC 27000 series and ISMS documents. ISMDS is a meta-database system that manages several databases of standards and documents. ISMDS is used by participants in ISMS as well as tools supporting the participants to perform tasks in ISMS lifecycle processes.

The paper reports our practices for InformationSecurity  class teaching and training with the last few years; for undergraduates majoring software engineering and employees from software industry. The ontological approach for teaching and training is adopted to manifest the advantage of knowledge organization and transformation. The demonstrations of our approach are presented with a set of instances for course-ware; and accompanied with comparisons of effects as well.',2012,'2018-11-29 12:53:34','2018-11-29 12:53:34',,'160–165',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,'InformationSecurity ; Ontology; Education; Software Engineering',,'Lysenko; V',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Security assessment is driven by regulatory compliance and the need to provide stakeholder assurance that information assets are adequately protected. A comprehensive and effective security assessment framework is thus vital to both corporate governance and management of security spending and investment. However; there is little evidence that such a framework is either available or widely adopted. InformationSecurity  practices that are based on well established practices are usually used to assess the effectiveness of the security function within an organization. Evidence indicates; however; that despite  organizational alignment and compliance with standards; losses associated with security incidents continue to occur and are on the increase. Two conclusions can be drawn: that the security controls defined by standards and frameworks are necessary but insufficient to ensure security; and that the measurement tools that support the management of InformationSecurity  are either not implemented or not available. Recent models for InformationSecurity  extend the scope of existing best practice security frameworks to include  organizational factors for security. Others have suggested the application of CSF analysis to ISM . While these extend the body of knowledge; they do not address the need for a corresponding assessment model. What is required is a comprehensive framework for security assessment that incorporates all relevant  organizational capabilities and competencies. The objective of this research is to generate a model that informs the development of such a framework. This paper explores the notion of InformationSecurity  from an  organizational perspective; and the various standards and frameworks that are currently used. The concepts of assessment and metrics are also examined in this context and; finally; a conceptual model for security assessment is presented together with an indication of its application.

Design/methodology/approach Case study research was conducted on a major bank. Semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of key stakeholders in the business; comprising senior managers; security professionals and branch employees were conducted. Findings SSM was particularly useful for exploring the holistic InformationSecurity  issues; enabling models to be constructed which were valuable analytical tools and easily understood by stakeholders; which increased the receptiveness of the bank; and assisted with member validation. Significant risks were apparent from internal sources with weaknesses in aspects of governance and security culture. Research limitations/implications This research uses a single case study and whilst it cannot be generalised; it identifies potential security issues others may face and solutions they may apply. Practical implications InformationSecurity  is complex and addresses technical; governance; management and cultural risks. Banking attacks are changing; with greater focus on employees and customers. A systemic approach is required for full consideration. SSM is a suitable approach for such analysis within large organisations. Originality/value This study demonstrates how important benefits can be obtained by using SSM alongside traditional risk assessment approaches to identify holistic security issues. A holistic approach is particularly important given the increasing complexity of the security threat surface. Banking was selected as a case study because it is both critical to society and is a prime target for attack. Furthermore; developing economies are under-represented in InformationSecurity  research; this paper adds to the evidence base. As global finance is highly interconnected; it is important that banks in such economies do not comprise a weak link; and hence; results from this case have value for the industry as a whole.',2017,'2018-11-29 12:53:37','2018-11-29 12:53:37',,'240–258',,3,25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,' ISM  (ISMS); Banking security; InformationSecurity  culture; Security governance; Socio-technical risks; Soft systems methodology (SSM)',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most critical asset of an organization is information which can be of any type i.e. electronic or in hard form.

Asset management is the methodical process of maintaining; upgrading and operating the assets. It has great significance to the business community as the value of assets is their influence on accomplishing the predefined organizational objectives. In academic institutes; information asset is used in teaching; research; administration and management; so all the assets containing useful information must be properly managed so that it remains available to the users.

However; moving patients medical information to the Cloud implies several risks in terms of the security and privacy of sensitive health records. In this paper; the risks of hosting Electronic Health Records (EHRs) on the servers of third-party Cloud service providers are reviewed. To protect the confidentiality of patient information and facilitate the process; some suggestions for health care providers are made. Moreover; security issues that Cloud service providers should address in their platforms are considered.      OBJECTIVE: To show that; before moving patient health records to the Cloud; security and privacy concerns must be considered by both health care providers and Cloud service providers. Security requirements of a generic Cloud service provider are analyzed.      METHODS: To study the latest in Cloud-based computing solutions; bibliographic material was obtained mainly from Medline sources. Furthermore; direct contact was made with several Cloud service providers.      RESULTS: Some of the security issues that should be considered by both Cloud service providers and their health care customers are role-based access; network security mechanisms; data encryption; digital signatures; and access monitoring. Furthermore; to guarantee the safety of the information and comply with privacy policies; the Cloud service provider must be compliant with various certifications and third-party requirements; such as SAS70 Type II; PCI DSS Level 1; ISO 27001; and the US Federal ISM  Act (FISMA).      CONCLUSIONS: Storing sensitive information such as EHRs in the Cloud means that precautions must be taken to ensure the safety and confidentiality of the data. A relationship built on trust with the Cloud service provider is essential to ensure a transparent process. Cloud service providers must make certain that all security mechanisms are in place to avoid unauthorized access and data breaches. Patients must be kept informed about how their data are being managed.',2013,'2018-11-29 12:53:40','2018-11-29 12:53:40',,,,8,15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,'PMID: 23965254',,,,'Security; Privacy; Cloud-computing; EHealth; Electronic health records (EHRs)',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results of the research. Modern development of   informationTechnology    significantly enhances the effective business activity; creates innovation competitive advantages for companies. In this context; the spread of smart production systems becomes especially popular. These systems manage things without human intervention and form the basis of concepts of Internet of Things and Industrial Internet of Things. As the current direction of InformationTechnology at the enterprise; Industrial Internet of Things enables operation processes developing and creates new options for the working environment as well as entirely new categories of jobs with their significant productivity increasing. In particular; it is confirmed by the economic results of implementation of largescale information systems for production management at modern enterprises by using system solutions of ERPclass. As a result of such projects implementation; the overall efficiency of the company may be increased by 20% or more. Starting using technology based on the Industrial Internet of Things; companies need to plan every step to increase efficiency and to stimulate the creation of product-service hybrid solutions; focused on the result. For example; attempts to change the situation for improving assets efficiency can become the basis for the creation of new services. To encourage the spread of Industrial Internet of Things; enterprises need technical resources like InformationTechnology infrastructure and labour resources like professionals with specific technical skills. Availability of necessary resources depends on firms investments in the infrastructure for collecting; storing and analysing data; as well as in staff. In addition; the development of InformationTechnology causes companies to increase investment in InformationSecurity  provision due to rising number of InformationSecurity  violations and increased severity of their consequences. In terms of ISM ; the company must ensure that the confidentiality; integrity and availability of its assets; information; data and InformationTechnology services always meet the requirements agreed with the business. In this regard; the companys ability to ensure InformationSecurity  is a key source of value; and the need to embed security into product design becomes important. Today the quality and efficiency of enterprises information system affect the final financial results through the quality of business processes. Companies that finance InformationSecurity  by residual principle can lose their competitive advantages. In addition; each firm has to solve the problem of how to consider expenditures in InformationSecurity  - as costs or investments and which approaches should be applied to their optimization. Typically; if the company has a long- term development strategy related to InformationTechnology; it considers the InformationSecurity  expenses as investments and seeks to make them promising; resorting to assess their economic efficiency and optimize the structure of investments. The criterion of economically expedient limits of investment in Industrial Internet of Things InformationSecurity  at the enterprise can be defined as a degree of protection of interests of all persons and objects who are dependent on information and communications systems that provide information. Conclusions and directions of further researches. Modern development of InformationTechnology provides companies with innovation competitive advantages and exacerbates the problems of InformationSecurity  provision for economic agents and cybercrime growth. The impact of information risks is realized through vulnerability of information systems that support different types of economic activities of industrial enterprises and through the companies losses due to leaks of confidential information; failures in information networks and systems. To prevent losses from cybercrime; companies should increase their investment in InformationSecurity ; guided by the criterion of economic expedient limits of investment; which provides sufficient protection from unauthorized access. Given the urgency of InformationTechnology systems development and ensuring their InformationSecurity  for the industrial enterprises; further scientific researches should be devoted to the justification for the use the Balanced Scorecard as a system of companys strategic management. The Balanced Scorecard should be based on the measurement and evaluation of enterprises efficiency with the help of the set of optimally matched indicators that reflect all aspects of the company.',2017,'2018-11-29 12:54:01','2018-11-29 12:54:01',,'177–186',,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years; CII become an attractive target for cyber attacks and the potential impact of a successful attack could lead to disastrous consequences in the physical world. Thus ensuring the security of CII is of vital importance. A fundamental prerequisite to secure a CII system is a clear understanding and a consistent view of its architecture.

In this paper; we propose a layered architectural view for CII; which aims at building a common ground among stakeholders and supporting the implementation of ISM  processes.

An analysis of professional competence models','Information Technology and People',,'09593845','10.1108/ITP-02-2017-0052',,'Purpose – InformationSecurity  policies (ISPs) are used by organizations to communicate rules on the use of information systems (IS). Research studies show that compliance with the ISPs is not a straightforward issue and that several factors influence individual behavior toward ISP compliance; such as security awareness or individual perception of security threats. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the competencies associated with users ISP compliance behavior. Design/methodology/approach – In order to reveal the competencies that are associated with the users ISP compliance behavior; the authors systematically analyze the ISP compliance literature and the authors develop an ISP compliance competency model. The authors then target to explore if IS users are equipped with these competencies; to do so; the authors analyze professional competence models from various industry sectors and compare the competencies that they include with the developed ISP compliance competencies. Findings – The authors identify the competencies associated with ISP compliance and the authors provide evidence on the lack of attention in InformationSecurity  responsibilities demonstrated in professional competence frameworks. Research limitations/implications – ISP compliance research has focused on identifying the antecedents of ISP compliance behavior. The authors offer an ISP compliance competency model and guide researchers in investigating the issue further by focusing on the professional competencies that are necessary for IS users. Practical implications – The findings offer new contributions to practitioners by highlighting the lack of attention on the InformationSecurity  responsibilities demonstrated in professional competence frameworks. The paper also provides implications for the design of InformationSecurity  awareness programs and  ISM in organizations.

Imaging studies include medical images; patient identification data; and proprietary information of the study; these data are contained in the storage device of a PACS. This system must preserve the confidentiality; integrity; and availability of patient information. There are techniques such as firewalls; encryption; and data encapsulation that contribute to the protection of information.

The case study research (CSR) was conducted in the form of interviews (n=25); questionnaires (n=45) and observations. Second; a design science research (DSR) exploits the combined CSR results for designing a model for a well-run ISMS audit. The CSR results shows that the different goals of a security audit can be in conflict. The results also indicate that KATAKRI has defects due to its inconsistency. One task of auditing processes should be collecting information about shortcomings of applied criteria. This papers new model for KATAKRI audits includes this activity.',2014,'2018-11-29 12:54:18','2018-11-29 12:54:18',,'240–243',,,,,,,,,,,'City of the Haque; InformationTechnologySS; IEEE; Tudelft; Netherlands Forensic Inst minist of Sec& Justice; NWO; IEEE Computer Soc',,,,,,,,,,,,,' ISM ; KATAKRI; national security auditing criteria; security auditing',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ISM standards use the recognized business management models very superficially. Standards do not make clear relations between ISM and InformationSecurity  Assurance (ISA). A real crisis in the ISM standardization is that it has no innovative solutions for modern business environments that emphasize speed; changes; agility; and complexity. The situational knowledge for the paper is based on worldwide observations by the authors through collaboration with many different contexts; organizations and expert networks.

Therefore; we present a viewpoint that we consider appropriate for identifying the origins of InformationSecurity  changes as well as their interrelations.

In this paper; we report the results from 5 in-depth interviews with CISOs; which were analysed using  organizational behaviour theory. The results show that the CISOs struggle to gain credibility within their organisation due to: a perceived lack of power; confusion about their role identity; and their inability to engage effectively with employees. We conclude that as the CISO role continues to develop CISOs need to reflect on effective ways of achieving credibility in their organisations and; in particular; to work on communicating with employees and engaging them in security initiatives. We also identify a key responsibility for effective CISOs; that is to remove the blockages that prevent InformationSecurity  from becoming business as usual rather than a specialist function.

With the increasing use of personal mobile devices and the trending adoption of Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) practices; this threat has become even more versatile and dreadful as it could hide behind the users typical and daily Internet activities. The importance of investigating whether the users intention to perform malware avoidance behaviours would change across multiple contexts is emphasised. Consequently; this study determines the contributing factors and compares their impacts on such intention by extending Protection Motivation Theory in two different contexts. A total of 252 Australian higher education students were surveyed when using mobile devices such as smartphone; laptop and tablet at home and at a BYOD-enabled university. Paired t-test; Bayesian structural equation modelling; and revised z-test were employed for data analysis. The empirical findings reveal that intention to perform malware avoidance behaviours differed across the contexts. Furthermore; the researchers found perceptions of self-efficacy and vulnerability to have different impacts on such intention and other variables in the model. As a result; such findings suggested developing community of practice and repeated trainings to maintain the users confidence in their own abilities to cope with malware threats. Message that focuses on the threats consequences was suggested to improve home users intention to avoid malware; along with a number of factors that could be critical to designing InformationSecurity  education programs. Moreover; these implications particularly address ISM  at educational institutions that adopt BYOD policy.

Even though many security managers are skeptical about outsourcing of {IT} security; others have cited reasons that are used for outsourcing of traditional {IT} functions for why security outsourcing is likely to increase. Our research offers a novel explanation; based on competitive externalities associated with {IT} security; for firms decisions to outsource {IT} security. We show that if competitive externalities are ignored; then a firm will outsource security if and only if the {MSSP} offers a quality (or a cost) advantage over in-house operations; which is consistent with the traditional explanation for security outsourcing. However; a higher quality is neither a prerequisite nor a guarantee for a firm to outsource security. The competitive risk environment and the nature of the security function outsourced; in addition to quality; determine firms outsourcing decisions. If the reward from the competitors breach is higher than the loss from own breach; then even if the likelihood of a breach is higher under the {MSSP} the expected benefit from the competitive demand externality may offset the loss from the higher likelihood of breaches; resulting in one or both firms outsourcing security. The incentive to outsource security monitoring is higher than that of infrastructure management because the {MSSP} can reduce the likelihood of breach on both firms and thus enhance the demand externality effect. The incentive to outsource security monitoring (infrastructure management) is higher (lower) if either the likelihood of breach on both firms is lower (higher) when security is outsourced or the benefit (relative to loss) from the externality is higher (lower). The benefit from the demand externality arising out of a security breach is higher when more of the customers that leave the breached firm switch to the non-breached firm.',2010,'2018-11-29 12:54:26','2018-11-29 12:54:26',,'301–320',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,'Moore; T and Pym; DJ and Ioannidis; C',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Introducing the concepts of quality improvement in medical practice represents a distinctive component of the hospital reform in Romania. Healthcare quality is a more important principle in sanitary field; because the level of patients knowledge is increasing concomitantly with the technological and therapeutic progresses. The continuous quality improvement is an obligatory condition for the achievement and maintaining the performance in healthcare organization; especially in hospital. The integration of many management systems (quality management; environmental management; security and occupational health management; ISM ) and the development of an integrated management model applicable to Romanian hospitals; which have as principal goal to improve the performance of health services; represent a challenge for the Romanian health system.

However; recent studies showed that the frequency of service disruptions is quite alarming even though there is BCM in place. Thus; this study investi- gates the current practice of BCM and the contributing factors; namely or- ganizations; people; process and technology to the failure of BCM imple- mentation in Malaysias public service. The study was undertaken using questionnaires whereby 195 InformationTechnology people participated in the study. The select- ed agencies are Frontline agencies and have implemented BCM. Findings showed that organization; people; process; and technology are significantly correlated with BCM failure in the Malaysian Public Sector. The empirical results reveal that process is the key factors contribute to the BCM failure followed humans; technology and organization policy; culture and structure. However; the current BCM approach is more toward technology oriented and only involves the InformationTechnology department. BCM implementation should involve all levels of the organization and cover all related critical business process. The results of this study have two implications: first; is the discovery of the factor that contribute to the BCM failure and second; the results of this study prioritized the factor that contributes to the BCM failure.

InformationSecurity  represents the cornerstone of every data processing system that resides in an organisations trusted network; implementing all necessary protocols; mechanisms and policies to be one step ahead of possible threats. Starting from the need to strengthen the set of security services; in this article we introduce a new and innovative process named controlled information destruction (CID) that is meant to secure sensitive data that are no longer needed for the organisations future purposes but would be very damaging if revealed. The disposal of this type of data has to be controlled carefully in order to delete not only the information itself but also all its splinters spread throughout the network; thus denying any possibility of recovering the information after its alleged destruction. This process leads to a modified model of information assurance and also reconfigures the architecture of any  ISM . The scheme we envisioned relies on a reshaped information lifecycle; which reveals the impact of the CID procedure directly upon the information states.',2015,'2018-11-29 12:54:34','2018-11-29 12:54:34',,'384–400',,4,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,'InformationSecurity ;  ISM ; controlled information destruction; information lifecycle; residual sensitive information',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One way companies can reduce their risk is to build fine-grained perimeters to protect critical assets. To achieve this vision; all assets need to be assigned a sensitivity value that properly indicates their business value and criticality to the organization. Existing classification schemes based on confidentiality; integrity; and availability are not sufficient. To address this need; we have developed Enterprise ISM  (EISM); which aims to semi-automatically measure the sensitivity levels of enterprise assets including both data and non-data assets. For the assets for which we can access the data content; we measure the sensitivity of an asset based on the sensitivity of the data by applying content analysis and data classification technologies. For the assets for which we cannot access data content; we score and rank the assets using external information such as the attributes of users and their usage patterns. We have piloted our solutions with a number of real-world cases; including the scanning of employees laptops; classification of business documents; and sensitivity ranking of servers without relying on data content. The experiments showed promising results; confirming that highly accurate and scalable automatic sensitivity estimation is feasible.

This pilot study is part of a larger research effort focused on exploring this topic. This is an interesting problem to study because security managers must make decisions based on instinct and experience rather than empirical security performance data. Yet some of the security managers are doing a decent job despite the lack of any empirical data. They face daily decisions on a variety of issues dealing with maintaining and improving the security integrity of their enterprises. While this is a constant problem confronting these managers; many are very successful. These effective managers; recognized by reputation; community and anecdotally; have ways of measuring effectiveness. However; these measures are more art and the data is only in the heads of the managers. Exploratory research was conducted to validate a method to explore how security managers make decisions about the allocation of security resources for their enterprise InformationSecurity  architectures. This paper presents the initial findings from the pilot study. The subjects of this pilot study were the Chief Technology and Chief Security Officers (CTO and CSO) of a large enterprise. The research method used was open-ended interviews followed by transcript analysis and categorization. The interview transcripts were analyzed to identify important themes and processes resulting in twenty-three categories of decision influences. While all categories are defined; five were common to the CTO and CSO and are highlighted. A key finding is that while the CTO and CSO share some concerns; they also have unique perspectives. This will be explored in future research from the perspective of effective team building for enterprise security management. The results of this pilot study will be used to compose a larger research effort to explore and document decision processes for successful security managers.',2012,'2018-11-29 12:54:44','2018-11-29 12:54:44',,'465–472',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,'George Washington University',,'Armistead; EL',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper the urgent problem of development of software of decision making support systems in InformationSecurity  is solved. Approach is based on a choice of rational options of response to events taking into account operational state-of-health data of a subject to protection. Objective. Goal of the research is developing a cyber-threats counterwork model using decision support system; choosing rational variants of reactions on the occurrences in cybersecurity; and taking into account current operational data. Method. The information object cyber security operational management system and the formation of the protection methods rational sets model which is based on a morphological approach is developed. It is proposed to find an optimal variant of the InformationSecurity  perimeter sets using an object function that maximizes the correlation of a consolidated figure of “InformationSecurity {”} to consolidated figure “costs{”}. Results. A model for the operational management of cyber security-critical computer systems was developed. This model allows us to generate different variants of protection sets that are compliant with a computer system taking into account morphological matrices for each security perimeter prepared with the intelligent decision support system. It is proved that the use of the developed decision support systems can significantly reduce the costs planned for the complex means of cyber defense; as well as reduce the time to inform decision-makers on how to counter the identified InformationSecurity  incidents. Conclusions. Scientific novelty of research consists that the model of operational management of cyber security of an information objects and formation of a rational complex of security features based on morphological approach is for the first time offered. The practical value of the developed methods and instruments is that they allow: to reduce time of development of systems of cyber security; to increase efficiency of planning of rational modular composition of security features due to creation of information and software environment in case of design; to increase validity of the made decisions on operational and to organizational technical control by protection.',2017,'2018-11-29 12:54:53','2018-11-29 12:54:53',,'109–116',,2,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The success can be achieved only in conditions   of a systematic approach of processes. A successful integration of   management systems depends on good planning and efficient   implementation. Companies are struggling to reduce production cost; make   more profit; and still meet with all the environmental; quality or   health and safety demands or create a better image to overcome   competition. Several standards have been developed to help companies in   their efforts to improve the sustainability of their systems and   products. However; implementing several standards simultaneously and   independently can be a costly and human resource demanding. Integrating   the standards is the mean of overcoming these difficulties. The   effectiveness of Integrated Management Systems (IMS) is becoming more   important for the organizations lately. Integrating two or more   management systems into an integrated management system can have the   following advantages: the simplification of existing management systems;   increasing the benefits of each system; optimization of resource   consumption; reduction of the maintenance costs of several management   systems; establishing a single framework for the continuous improvement   of all processes in your organization. This paper examines various   models of integrated management systems in accordance with professional   references ISO 9001; ISO 18001 and OHSAS 18001; highlighting strengths   and weaknesses.

However; studies that directly compare FDG-PET/CT results with histopathology are currently lacking.      PURPOSE: To directly compare both visual and quantitative bone marrow FDG-PET/CT to BMB at the right posterior iliac crest in patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL.      MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 40 patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL; who had undergone FDG-PET/CT before BMB of the right posterior iliac crest; were retrospectively included. FDG-PET/CT images were visually assessed for bone marrow involvement in the right posterior iliac crest. 3D partial volume corrected mean standardized uptake value (cSUVmean); maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax); and peak standardized uptake value (SUVpeak) were measured in the right posterior iliac crest; using volume of interest analysis. BMB of the right posterior iliac crest was used as reference standard for bone marrow involvement.      RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity of visual FDG-PET/CT analysis for the detection of bone marrow involvement in the right posterior iliac crest were 14.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]; 0.5-53.4%) and 100% (95% CI; 87.6-100%); respectively. cSUVmean; SUVmax; and SUVpeak of BMB-negative patients (1.4 ± 0.49; 2.2 ± 0.69; and 1.7 ± 0.59; respectively) considerably overlapped with those of BMB-positive patients (1.8 ± 0.53; 2.7 ± 0.71; and 2.2 ± 0.61; respectively).

As the number of e-government services introduced to the user increases; a higher level of e-government security is required. This article aims to formulate the key factors for security management. Firstly introduce the concept of e-government and InformationSecurity ; presents a review of ICT management in the public sector; ISM  and e-government in recent literature by focusing on issues and trends. The paper then for successful e-government security management analyses the key factors. Put forward a managerial conceptual framework followed.

The Enterprise InformationSecurity  Architecture (EISA) offers a framework upon which business security requirements; the risks and the threats are analyzed and a portfolio of the best integrated enterprise security solutions is put together. Frameworks and models introduced in the past six years have examined different aspects of EISA. We realized the diversity of the mentioned approaches and in this paper; first; we develop two facets according to which these approaches are categorized. These facets are abstraction level (holistic vs. partial) and architectural viewpoint (managerial vs. technical). As interoperability is the primary focus of our study and it is a broad concept; we restrict our discussion to holistic frameworks and models. In this regard; we survey the prominent holistic approaches namely Gartner; SABSA; RISE frameworks; AGM-based model and intelligent Service-Oriented EISA. In the next step; we compare the mentioned frameworks from technical; organizational and semantic interoperability aspects. We conclude that none of the frameworks; not even those which are holistic; practical and greatly elaborated; have explored interoperability clearly. We assert that the competitive advantages offered by interoperability; justify the costs needed for implementing the incompatible concepts of interoperability and security along with each other.

The results of the analysis discovered the evidence of those ICT outsourcing project characteristics; risks exploited through Vulnerabilities Risks Factor (VRF). Several highly critical ICT outsourcing project characteristics were project team size between 10 to 99 members (33.6%); medium size project (28.2%) and outsource the ICT project to more than one service provider. The findings could be used as an indicator for organizations to prepare more effective ISM  plan for ICT Outsourcing project.

Design/methodology/approach – The research used the metaphor of boundary turbulence in the Communication Privacy Management (CPM) theory to demonstrate the psychological effect on employees. The model comprised organizational culture; CPM; trust; and employee performance in employee monitoring to further investigated the influence exerted by organizational culture and how employees viewed their trust within the organization when implementing employee monitoring. Variables were measured empirically by administrating questionnaires to full-time employees in organizations that currently practice employee monitoring. Findings – The findings showed that a control-oriented organizational culture raised communication privacy turbulence in CPM. The communication privacy turbulence in CPM mostly had negative effects on trust in employee monitoring policy; but not on trust in employee monitoring members. Both trust in employee monitoring policy and trust in employee monitoring members had positive effects on employee commitment and compliance to employee monitoring. Research limitations/implications – This research applied the CPM theory in workplace privacy to explore the relationship between employees privacy and trust. The results provide insights of why employees feel psychological resistance when they are forced to accept the practice of employee monitoring. In addition; this study explored the relationship between CPM and trust; and offer support and verification to prior studies. Practical implications – For practitioners; the findings help organizations to improve the performance of their employees and to design a more effective environment for employee monitoring. Originality/value – A research model was proposed to study the impacts of CPM on employee monitoring; after a broad survey on related researches. The validated model and its corresponding study results can be referenced by organization managers and decision makers to make favorable tactics for achieving their goals of implementing employee monitoring.

The level of awareness of these risks in this sector appears to be low despite effort to address these challenges in government and private sector initiatives and conferences. The draft paper on InformationSecurity  (Dept of Public service and administration n.d. p2) and the CSIRT initiative clearly point to the fact that success in government electronic initiatives depends on effective ISM . The present study examined some of the factors inhibiting the recognition and reporting of losses from cyber-attacks on government departments in South Africa. A survey was conducted in the Western Cape Province. Forty responses were received and analysed using mixed methods. The results indicate that lack of clear guidance on how to calculate losses; lack of understanding of the legislation and knowledge of how it may assist in cubing cyber-crime; lack of training and creation of awareness of cyber-crime and lack of knowledge and capability to assess risks regularly are major factors inhibiting departments from recognising and reporting losses from cyber attacks.

A holistic framework is provided for fostering an InformationSecurity  culture in SMEs in a national setting. The paper discusses key managerial challenges for SMEs attempting to develop such a culture. The main findings suggest that Australian SME owners do not provide sufficient support for InformationSecurity  due to insufficient awareness of its importance and may also be affected by national attitudes to risk.

In this paper we propose a game theoretic model which optimally allocates cyber security resources such as administrators time across different tasks. We first model the interactions between an omnipresent attacker and a team of system administrators seen as the defender; and we have derived the mixed Nash Equilibria (NE) in such games. We have formulated general-sum games that represent our cyber security environment; and we have proven that the defenders Nash strategy is also minimax. This result guarantees that independently from the attackers strategy the defenders solution is optimal. We also propose Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) as an efficient technique to com- pute approximate equilibria in our games. By implementing and evaluating a minimax solver with SVD; we have thoroughly investigated the improvement that Nash defense introduces compared to other strategies chosen by common sense decision algorithms. Our key finding is that a particular NE; which we call weighted NE; provides the most effective defense strategy. In order to validate this model we have used real-life statistics from Hackmageddon; the Verizon 2013 Data Breach Investigation report; and the Ponemon report of 2011. We finally compare the game theoretic defense method with a method which implements a stochastic optimization algorithm.',2014,'2018-11-29 12:55:30','2018-11-29 12:55:30',,'15–29',,,428,,,,'IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology',,,,'IFIP',,,,,,,,,'PMID: 20960968',,,,,,'CuppensBoulahia; N and Cuppens; F and Jajodia; S and ElKalam; AA and Sans; T',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nearly all carcinomas had alpha gamma-enolase expression and in 20% of the carcinomas gamma gamma-enolase could be detected (so-called neuron-specific enolase). By discriminant analysis; the function giving the best discrimination compared to the histological data was based on natural logarithm aldolase and the total of gamma-enolase subunits. Contrary to expectation; the regulator enzymes of glycolysis; i.e.; hexokinase; phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase were not included in this discriminant function. The best fit produced a 90% correct classification in both benign and malignant disease. If these findings are confirmed to a larger series; the discrimination is sufficiently strong to form the basis of a clinically useful tool.',1987,'2018-11-29 12:55:32','2018-11-29 12:55:32',,'251–263',,,8,,,,'Interdisciplinary Management Research-Interdisziplinare Managementforschung',,,,'Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek; Fac Econ Osijek; Postgraduate Studies Management; Hochschule Pforzheim Univ',,,,,,,,,'PMID: 3448771',,,,'Breast cancer; Glycolytic enzymes; Tumor markers',,'Bacher; U and Barkovic; D and Dernoscheg; KH and LamzaMaronic; M and Matic; B and Pap; N and Runzheimer; B',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Answering the main research question:  Which practices at the level of Governance are relevant for Business InformationSecurity  Maturity  The initial phase of this research consists of a review of academic and practice-oriented literature on these relevant practices. This list of practices is then examined and validated through expert panel research using a Group Support System (GSS). The paper ultimately identifies a list of 22 core principles.

The degree of information assurance comes into question; however; when external databases are accessed; combined and analyzed to form new perspectives. ISO/IEC 17799;   informationTechnology -Security techniques-Code of practice for ISM ; can be used to establish a higher level of information assurance among disparate entities using data mining in the defense; homeland security; commercial and other civilian/commercial domains. Organizations that meet ISO/IEC InformationSecurity  standards have identified and assessed risks; threats and vulnerabilities and have taken significant proactive steps to meet their unique security requirements. The ISO standards address twelve domains: risk assessment and treatment; security policy; organization of InformationSecurity ; asset management; human resources security; physical and environmental security; communications and operations management; access control; information systems acquisition; development and maintenance; InformationSecurity  incident management and business continuity management and compliance. Analysts can be relatively confident that if organizations are ISO 17799 compliant; a high degree of information assurance is likely to be a characteristic of the data sets being used. The reverse may be true. Extracting; fusing and drawing conclusions based upon databases with a low degree of information assurance may be wrought with all of the hazards that come from knowingly using bad data to make decisions.

The primary goal of this paper is to show the frequency of application of integrated management systems in Croatian companies in practice focusing on the business clusters. The other goal of the paper is to present the management systems that are most frequently integrated in Croatian business practice; also with the same focus on clusters. Qualitative research methodology was used in this paper while the data was collected combining the primary and secondary sources. Two working hypotheses were set up on literature-based analysis. The first hypothesis is that most of the companies and clusters in the Republic of Croatia has implemented an integrated management system. The second hypothesis is that most companies and clusters integrated the Quality Management System (ISO 9001) and the Environmental Management System (ISO 14001).

InformationSecurity  involves both storing and accessing sensitive information and data warehousing. It can be carried out with Data Processing Centers. A number of standards were developed to improve efficiency of InformationSecurity  departments. One of them is ISO/IEC 27001. It involves requirements to  ISM which are obligatory for certification. Along with management elements for computers and networks; ISO/IEC 27001 specifies the issues of security policy development; staff relations. Processed InformationSecurity  is one of the crucial issues when creating new data processing centers. Accordingly; reliability and fault-tolerance of data centers in the Uptime Institutes Tier Classification System are paid special attention to. Operational Sustainability is an additional characteristics to asses DPCs performance. Advantage of the standard is due to the flexibility of its requirements which enable objective evaluation of DPCs performance at the design stage and comparison of the current performance. Data centers can be awarded with Tier 1 to 4 depending upon the degree of reliability. Tiers is progressive: each Tier incorporates the requirements of all the lower Tiers. The Uptime Institute also developed Tier Standard: Topology and Tier Standard: Operational Sustainability which specify the methods of DPC performance evaluation.

In this study; we address the vulnerability of login credentials. First; based on a unique Internet user data set; we analyze the behavioral characteristics of login credentials usage. We find that the same login credentials are used for many more accounts and reused much more often than previously expected. Furthermore; usage patterns are found to be quite skewed. Second; building on a network perspective of login credentials usage; we suggest a vulnerability measure of an individuals login credentials and analyze the vulnerability of current Internet users.

The identified categories of factors are followed differently by employees working in Health; Business and Education. Questionnaire analysis as part of this study suggests that employees in the health sector comply the most in adhering with InformationSecurity  policy as compared to other sectors. One of the reasons for this is that health sector employees have better awareness; robust communication and effective training programmes with reinforcement and satisfaction.

Although awareness of information   threats is growing in the Western world; in places like Saudi Arabia;   InformationSecurity  is very poor. Unlike Western pluralistic   democracies; Saudi Arabia is a highly-censored country; with a   patriarchal and tribal culture; which may influence its poor information   security rating. This paper examines the level of InformationSecurity    (InfoSec) practices among the InformationTechnology departments in organizations in Saudi   Arabia; using an online survey; based on instruments produced by   specialist organizations on InformationSecurity  such as the Malaysian   Cyber Security Organization; the Excellence of Information Assurance   Centre; and Alelm organization in Saudi Arabia. The survey attracted 124   respondents and the results indicated that InformationSecurity  in Saudi   Arabian organizations is quite low. Several of the areas of weakness in   InfoSec appear to be related to the level of censorship or the   patriarchal and tribal nature of Saudi culture. This study has clearly   indicated that InformationSecurity  in Saudi Arabia faces some serious   risks from a range of threat types. There is a need to reduce the risks   faced and provide good strategies for further protection from threats   quickly.

The networks are helping to transfer vital and often highly sensitive information while ordinary users are also connected to access network. Protecting the information of an enterprise is a must in the competitive world of information age. With the growing network size and complexity; their protection from threats has become increasingly difficult. The problem with network security solutions is that technology driven; non-integrated products such as firewalls and intrusion detectors provide only protection for specific type of threats. But the need for the organization today is comprehensive coverage of threats to their enterprise networks. Individual security products often lack inter-oper ability; scalability and ease of manageability. So a holistic security management and centralized control solution that integrates and manages the different security appliances is required for enterprise networks. This paper offers implementation of such solution for ISM . In any organization information assurance is very much important. It requires integrity of the network system with respect to security appliances of different varieties in the network. Information assurance also requires centralized log gathering and analysis for getting unified view; which will make monitoring and troubleshooting easier. Centralized log analysis helps in timely situation awareness with respect to organizational policy implementation. This will also help in easy classification of the policy violations caused either by the known source (administrators) or external malicious users; thus providing the information assurance to the organization.',2005,'2018-11-29 12:56:05','2018-11-29 12:56:05',,'180–184',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,'Arabnia; HR',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indeed; todays businesses have still not been widely convinced to invest in InformationSecurity  initiatives; resulting in the shrinking budget allocated for  organizational InformationSecurity . One common finding shows that  organizational awareness towards InformationSecurity  can serve as a great driver that would help firms realise the business values of such investments. In addition; such emphasis on the awareness suggests the essential role of training; education and dissemination of quality information. As a result; one could argue that the available information has an indirect influence on the adoption rate of InformationSecurity ; through the impact of awareness. This research analyses the possibility of whether information availability could directly drive the intention to invest in InformationSecurity  initiatives by removing the uncertainty surrounding such investments. In other words; information availability per se could drive investing intention by reducing the obstacle - its uncertainty - rather than stimulate business needs through the enforcing of another factor that is awareness. Through intensive reviews on the literature; this paper synthesises and reports on the definition of information availability and how it could drive the intention to invest in InformationSecurity . Specifically; the researchers examine the driving force of internal information (risk management; staff suggestions); external information (consultants; external audit) and general information (white papers; security reports). By exploring the direct relationship between information availability and intention to invest in InformationSecurity ; more practical recommendations and directions to promote  organizational InformationSecurity  can be suggested. Before that; the researchers aim to update the readers with an understanding of the role of information availability in ISM .',2013,'2018-11-29 12:56:06','2018-11-29 12:56:06',,'71–80',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,'Blooma; J and Nkhoma; M and Leung; N',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Perhaps as a result; InformationSecurity  guidelines published by select agent regulators lack the critical details and directives needed to achieve even the lowest security level of the Federal ISM  Act (FISMA). While only government agencies are currently required to abide by the provisions of FISMA (unless specified as preconditions for obtaining government grants or contracts–still a relatively rare or narrowly scoped occurrence); the same strategies were recently recommended by executive order for others. We propose that InformationSecurity  guidelines for select agent research be updated to promulgate and detail FISMA standards and processes and that the latter be ultimately incorporated into select agent regulations.

Data was collected from organizations located in different geographic regions of the world; and the amount of data collected from two countries - namely; USA and Sweden - allowed us to investigate if the effect of behavioral InformationSecurity  governance factors on the establishment of security knowledge sharing differs based on national culture. The study followed a mixed methods research design; wherein qualitative data was collected to both establish the studys research model and develop a survey instrument that was distributed to 578 InformationSecurity  executives. The results suggest that processes to coordinate implemented security knowledge sharing mechanisms have a major direct influence on the establishment of security knowledge sharing in organizations; the effect of organizational structure (e.g.; centralized security function to develop and deploy uniform firm-wide policies; and use of steering committees to facilitate InformationSecurity  planning) is slightly weaker; while business-based ISM  has no significant direct effect on security knowledge sharing. A mediation analysis revealed that the reason for the nonsignificant direct relation between business-based ISM  and security knowledge sharing is the fully mediating effect of coordinating InformationSecurity  processes. Thus; the results disentangles the interrelated influences of behavioral InformationSecurity  governance factors on security knowledge sharing by showing that InformationSecurity  governance sets the platform to establish security knowledge sharing; and coordinating processes realize the effect of both the structure of the InformationSecurity  function and the alignment of ISM  with business needs. A multigroup analysis identified that national culture had a significant moderating effect on the association between four of the six proposed relations. In Sweden - which is seen as a less individualist; feminine country - managers tend to focus their efforts on implementing controls that are aligned with business activities and employees need; monitoring the effectiveness of the implemented controls; and assuring that the controls are not too obtrusive to the end-user. On the contrary; US organizations establish security knowledge sharing in their organization through formal arrangements and structures. These results imply that Swedish managers perceive it to be important to involve; or at least know how their employees cope with the decisions that have been made; thus favoring local participation in ISM ; while US managers may feel the need to have more central control when running their InformationSecurity  function. The findings suggest that national culture should be taken into consideration in future studies - in particular when investigating organizations operating in a global environment - and understand how it affects behaviors and decision-making.

Thus; these issues need to be addressed efficiently; especially in organizations in which data are a valuable asset. Design/methodology/approach Before developing the instrument for the survey; first; effective measurement built upon existing literature review was identified and developed and the survey questionnaires were set according to past studies and the findings based on qualitative analyses. Data were collected by using cross-sectional questionnaire and a Likert scale; whereby each question was related to an item as in the work of Witherspoonet al. (2013 ). Data analysis was done using the SPSS.3B. Findings Based on the results from three surveys and findings; a principle of InformationSecurity  compliance practices was proposed based on the authors proposed nine-five-circle (NFC) principle that enhances ISM  by identifying human conduct and InformationTechnology security-related issues regarding the aspect of ISM . Furthermore; the authors principle has enabled closing the gap between technology and humans in this study by proving that the factors in the present studys finding are interrelated and work together; rather than on their own. Research limitations/implications The main objective of this study was to address the lack of research evidence on what mobilizes and influences ISM  development and implementation. This objective has been fulfilled by surveying; collecting and analyzing data and by giving an account of the attributes that hinder ISM . Accordingly; a major practical contribution of the present research is the empirical data it provides that enable obtaining a bigger picture and precise information about the real issues that cause ISM  shortcomings. Practical implications In this sense; despite the fact that this study has limitations concerning the development of a diagnostic tool; it is obviously the main procedure for the measurements of a framework to assess InformationSecurity  compliance policies in the organizations surveyed. Social implications The present studys discoveries recommend in actuality that using flexible tools that can be scoped to meet individual organizational needs have positive effects on the implementation of ISM  policies within an organization. Accordingly; the research proposes that organizations should forsake the oversimplified generalized guidelines that neglect the verification of the difference in InformationSecurity  requirements in various organizations. Instead; they should focus on the issue of how to sustain and enhance their organizations compliance through a dynamic compliance process that involves awareness of the compliance regulation; controlling integration and closing gaps. Originality/value The rapid growth of   informationTechnology    has created numerous business opportunities. At the same time; this growth has increased InformationSecurity  risk. InformationTechnology security risk is an important issue in industrial sectors; and in organizations that are innovating owing to globalization or changes in organizational culture.

This is in addition of showing to them that cloud computing environment provide methods for establishing and maintaining the integrity of information as well as its availability and its processing. Much as there are many advantages of deploying services in the cloud; there are numerous InformationSecurity  issues associated with it since it encompasses many technologies including networks; databases; operating systems; and people. The major objective of this study was to identify these issues and to develop an ISM  framework for cloud based environment. From related literature; relevant issues were identified using textual analysis and grouped into six categories of; organizational; environmental; contingency management; security policy; internal control; and information and risk management. These issues were validated in a framework by using the analytical hierarchical process (AHP) method. Results of the study indicated that; environmental issues play a critical role in the ISM  as compared to other issues whereas the information and risk management issues were found not to be so significant. This study contributes to the ISM  body of knowledge by providing a single empirically validated framework that will be used theoretically to extend research in the domain of this study and practically by management while making decisions relating to security management in cloud computing. I. INTRODUCTION The growing trends in cloud computing technology has seen network security threat vectors increasingly change from relatively simplistic signature-based threats to more complex behavior-based threats. The major concern about cloud computing technology is the fact that owners of data may still have no control of where the data is placed. This is because if anyone want to utilise the benefits of the cloud; then he/she should t use the resource allocation and the framework provided by cloud vendors. Therefore; there is a need to ensure the safety amidist of the allocated untrusted processes. On the other hand; the vulnerabilities to attack the large traditional Web applications; smaller embedded applications; networked devices and operating systems is exponentially making InformationSecurity  managers work painful. Large data storages and online transactions like the use of debit and credit card payments have remained a center of attraction to many attackers.',2016,'2018-11-29 12:56:25','2018-11-29 12:56:25',,'349–354',,,,,,,,,,,'UK Simulat Soc; Asia Modelling & Simulat Sect; IEEE; IEEE Comp Soc UK & RI Sect; IEEE Reg 8; European Federat Simulat Soc; European Council Modelling & Simulat; Kingston Univ; Imperial Coll; Machine Intelligence Res Labs; Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol; Not',,,,,,,,,,,,,'cloud computing; analytical hierarchical process; InformationSecurity  issues; integrated system theory; Theories of InformationSecurity ',,'Aldabass; D and Orsoni; A and Cant; R and Ibrahim; Z and Saad; I',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To ensure that IS is effectively enforced and executed; many organisations have introduced ISM  initiatives. IS standards; policies; guidelines and procedures are formulated to guide organisations in implementing ISM. Despite the extensive efforts; organisations are still exposed to security threats and risks due to ineffective ISM practices. One possible cause of this phenomenon is that organisations are unaware of the factors that influence the success of ISM. This study aims to address this concern by analysing the existing literature in order to identify the success factors of ISM. Six related studies together with the ISM international standard; guideline and model were reviewed and compared. To conceptualise the factors; the literature was analysed qualitatively using content analysis. Based on the analysis; the study has compiled a number of factors and elements that contribute to the success of ISM. The factors are grouped into three main aspects; namely People; Process and Organisation. The People need to possess certain attributes in order to perform the key ISM Process; which should be supported by the Organisation through the establishment of specific guidance. By understanding the ISM success factors; the ISM implementation in organisations is believed to be gradually improved and become effective.',2016,'2018-11-29 12:56:30','2018-11-29 12:56:30',,'1924–1929',,8,22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,'InformationSecurity ; ISM ; Success factors',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It attempts to answer three fundamental questions; what to do; why and how? to protect the information and Information Systems of possible incidents related to the InformationSecurity  that may affect confidentiality; integrity and availability of information. The main variables to be considered are defined and their possible values are proposed. These variables are obtained by means of an interpretative epistemological approach; through a literature review; the use of research methods of Contents Analysis; Focus Group and the General Morphologic Analysis method. To respond in an integrated manner to the three questions above; the model considers the possible incidents of InformationSecurity  in Information Systems; taking into account primarily the main components of the security risks of Information Systems that collect; store; process; transmit and disseminate the information. Its operation is guided by the military concepts of Information Warfare; Information Assurance; the most important principles of war applied to Defensive Operations and the military doctrine of Information Operations. Given the type of problem identified in the study; focusing primarily on the analysis of scenarios of InformationSecurity  incidents and interconnection with the planning and selection of security controls; the method used is the General Morphological Analysis. This method allows for the prediction of possible scenarios of incidents related to InformationSecurity  at the organizational level; which results in the selection of the most efficient solution of security controls; to maximize the security of information. InformationSecurity  must guarantee confidentiality; integrity and availability of information and seeks to contribute; by means of the operational implementation of the military concept of Information Assurance; to achieve the information superiority.',2012,'2018-11-29 12:56:37','2018-11-29 12:56:37',,'172–VIII',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,'Security Management; Computer Security; Information Warfare; Network Security',,'Filiol; E and Erra; R',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

InformationSecurity  policy is often described as part of these frameworks. InformationSecurity  policy is therefore considered an essential tool for ISM  by most relevant sources. Though InformationSecurity  in small companies faces the same requirements as in large companies; some differences do exist. Companies generally dispose of limited resources (e.g. time and money) to spend on InformationSecurity  measures. At the same time the amount and type of information to be protected is different. Most InformationSecurity  policies are drafted from the viewpoint of large companies. Small companies often have to translate policies that had been written for major companies in order to fit their needs: a costly contextual adjustment. However; how these policies can be applied; and which parts can be left out (due to the size of the company) is not much discussed in literature. Empirical materials show that small companies often simply choose not to document InformationSecurity  policies. This paper introduces work inspired by the parallel established between the literature and existing practice in small companies. The paper analyses several InformationSecurity  policy guidelines from the viewpoint of small companies. The guidelines are analyzed on how they instruct the documentation of InformationSecurity  policy; and whether they offer any alternatives. Empirical findings from interviews in small Finnish companies are reflected upon based on this analysis. Through a series of interviews conducted in support of the comparative analysis; the reasons for documenting or not documenting InformationSecurity  policy are discussed; along with other ISM  issues. The ultimate goal of the paper is to offer an informative discussion on how certain InformationSecurity  policy guidelines could be applied to meet the needs of small companies.',2009,'2018-11-29 12:56:40','2018-11-29 12:56:40',,'112–117',,,,,,,,,,,'Mil Acad Lisbon; Univ Minho',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,'Santos; H',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since employees who comply with the InformationSecurity  rules and regulations of the organization are the key to strengthening InformationSecurity ; understanding compliance behavior is crucial for organizations that want to leverage their human capital. This research identifies the antecedents of employee compliance with the InformationSecurity  policy (ISP) of an organization. Specifically; we investigate the rationality- based factors that drive an employee to comply with requirements of the ISP with regard to protecting the organizations information and technology resources. Drawing on the theory of planned behavior; we posit that; along with normative belief and self-efficacy; an employees attitude toward compliance determines intention to comply with the ISP. As a key contribution; we posit that an employees attitude is influenced by benefit of compliance; cost of compliance; and cost of noncompliance; which are beliefs about the overall assessment of consequences of compliance or noncom- pliance. We then postulate that these beliefs are shaped by the employees outcome beliefs concerning the events that follow compliance or noncompliance: benefit of compliance is shaped by intrinsic benefit; safety of resources; and rewards; while cost of compliance is shaped by work impediment; and cost of noncompliance is shaped by intrinsic cost; vulnerability of resources; and sanctions. We also investigate the impact of InformationSecurity  awareness (ISA) on outcome beliefs and an employees attitude toward compliance with the ISP. Our results show that an employees intention to comply with the ISP is significantly influenced by attitude; normative beliefs; and self-efficacy to comply. Outcome beliefs significantly affect beliefs about overall assessment of consequences; and they; in turn; significantly affect an employees attitude. Furthermore; ISA positively affects both attitude and outcome beliefs. As the importance of employees following their organizations InformationSecurity  rules and regulations increases; our study sheds light on the role of ISA and compliance-related beliefs in an organizations efforts to encourage compliance.',2010,'2018-11-29 12:56:41','2018-11-29 12:56:41',,523,,3,34,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,'PMID: 21149287',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The challenge of meeting these obligations has become a complex web of requirements that grows exponentially as organisations cross international boundaries. This paper attempts to provide an interpretation of the legal aspects; as a starting point for clarifying compliance issues; as referred to by ISO/IEC 27002 (ISO/IEC 27002; 2005; previously known as ISO/IEC 17799; 2005).

This paper examines why this may be the case by investigating what has driven the accreditation under the standard in 18 UK companies; representing a fifth of companies accredited at the time of the research. An initial literature review suggests that adoption could be driven by external pressures; or simply an objective of improving operational performance and competitive performance. It points to the need to investigate the influence of Regulators and Legislators; Competitors; Trading Partners and Internal Stakeholders on the decision to seek accreditation. An inductive analysis of the reasons behind adoption of accreditation and its subsequent benefits suggests that competitive advantage is the primary driver of adoption for many of the companies we interviewed. We also find that an important driver of adoption is that the standard enabled organisations to access best practice in ISM  thereby facilitating external relationships and communication with internal stakeholders. Contrary to the accepted orthodoxy and what could be expected from the literature; increased regulation and the need to comply with codes of practice are not seen as significant drivers for companies in our sample.',2004,'2018-11-29 12:56:45','2018-11-29 12:56:45',,'1–20',,,193,,,,'INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION FOR INFORMATION PROCESSING',,,,'IFIP TC 11 WG 11 1; IFIP TC 11 WG 11 5',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,'Dowland; P and Furnell; S and Thuraisingham; B and Wang; XS',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although a number of institutional theories deal with information systems (IS) innovation in organizations; most of these institutional-centered frameworks overlook external economic efficiency and internal organizational capability in the presence of pressures of institutional conformity. Using Korea as the institutional setting; our research model posits that economic-based consideration will moderate the institutional conformity pressure on InformationSecurity  adoption while organization capability will influence the institutional confirmation of InformationSecurity  assimilation. The model is empirically tested using two-stage survey data from a field study of 140 organizations in Korea. The results indicate that in addition to institutional influences; our six proposed economic-based and organizational capability moderating variables all have significant influences on the degree of the adoption and assimilation of ISM .

Other requirements like those arising from legislation; requirements of local communities and environment also require organizations to adapt. To help organizations meet all these requirements they can use existing tools such as ISO 9001; ISO 14001; ISO 27001 and other standards. By integrating multiple ISO standards into one integrated system its possible to meet a wider range of requirements. The paper analyzes the possibility to integrate the ISO 9001:2008 quality management system with ISO 27001:2010  ISM  and application possibilities of the integrated system in practice. Organization with implemented quality management system proves that its quality management system complies with the requirements of ISO 9001:2008. Thus the risk of uncertainty in customers towards the quality of products or services is reduced; so organizations are increasingly seeking to obtain this certification. As some organizations require not only the quality of products and services; but also the safety of these; ISO 9001:2008 is a great start for organizations towards implementation of other ISO standards; in this case the ISO 27001:2010. The purpose of ISO 27001:2010 is to show customers that InformationSecurity  in the organization is carried out in the best possible way and to gain their trust. Therefore we can say that the ISO 27001:2010 means for InformationSecurity  the same thing as ISO 9001:2008 means for quality management system. In this paper will be shown how to implement the standards individually and whether there is the possibility of integrating these standards.',2014,'2018-11-29 12:56:59','2018-11-29 12:56:59',,'368 – 373',,,,,,,'Medunarodni Znanstveni Simpozij Gospodarstvo Istocne Hrvatske-Jucer Danas Sutra',,,,'Univ Strossmayer Osijek; Fac Econ Osijek; Croatian Acad Arts & Sci; Minist Econ Republ Croatia; Hypo Alpe Adria; gradnja; Studio hs Internet; KONZUM; BELJE',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,'Tonkovic; AM',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper documents a study of twenty enterprises; six of them in the critical infrastructure (CI) domain. The state of security in the CI enterprises differed little from that in the other enterprises. InformationSecurity  was seen as a technical problem with technical solutions. However; vulnerabilities in processes and human fallibility create a need for formal and informal controls in addition to technical controls. These three controls are interdependent. They vary widely in implementation time and resource needs; which render the task of building security resources a challenging problem. This paper presents a system dynamics model that illustrates how security controls are interconnected and are interdependent at a high level. The model is intended to aid security managers in CI domains to better understand ISM  strategies; especially the complexities involved in managing a socio-technical system where human; organizational and technical factors interact. The model also demonstrates how the knowledge gained from proactive security activities can help managers improve the effectiveness of security controls; risk assessments and incident detection capabilities.

For this; staggered lists of InformationTechnology security measurements are constructed (Guttman scales) whereas the Code of Practice ISO/IEC 27002 provides the objectives and recommendations relating to ISM  in this regard. The FMEA approach finally structures the overall risk analysis process. A questionnaire/survey design using this Best Practice FMEA enables the analyst to represent the results in the form of matrices of measurements with regard to the Codes Objectives improving statistical analysis and validity. In this paper; the statistical evaluation process uses k-means. This is a nonhierarchical clustering method which is compared with hierarchical clustering methods. With regard to applicability; the k-means approach is found easier to implement at (small and medium-sized) enterprises. The representation of results is more comprehensive for complex data bases. Apart from that; both clustering methods are equivalent as they group the Objectives in the same way. The results of a literature research show the placement of Best Practice FMEA among other InformationTechnology risk assessment approaches; e.g. CRAMM and OCTAVE-S. Comparison criteria are derived from the ISO/IEC-Guide 73. It becomes apparent that Best Practice FMEA is most applicable at small-scale enterprises which are not fully covered by the other approaches.

To ensure continued delivery of these critical services; it is important to ensure that the process control systems used to control; monitor and manage the infrastructure are secured against physical and cyber security threats. A number of InformationSecurity  standards have been defined by various industry and government regulatory bodies to provide guidance in securing process control systems.

The Norwegian Oil and Gas Industry has started to adopt new information communication technology to connect its offshore platforms; onshore control centers; and suppliers. In oil companies; the management is generally aware of the increasing risks associated with operational transition; however; to date; investment in incident response capability has not been highly prioritized because of the uncertainty related to risks and the present reactive mental model of security risk management. The model simulation shows that a reactive approach to security risk management might trap the organization into blindness to minor incidents and low incident response capability; which can lead to severe incidents.

For this reason; security managers need to correctly understand; achieve and maintain a dynamic equilibrium between all of them. The development of a simulation model can be an efficient approach towards this objective; as it involves making explicit key factors in security management and their interconnections to efficiently reduce organizational security risks.

The existence of a competitive information environment; which is a specific arena for special information operations; shows the necessity for implemention of information resources complex protection. Information warfare and the problems; those arise in the field of complex ISM ; determine the relevance of the information decision support models development; as well as the creation of situational or information-analytical centers of the complex InformationSecurity  at the “Enterprise - Region - State{”} management levels. Objective. The goal of this research is a development of information decision support model of the complex ISM  of the multi-level socio-technical system which is consists of the individual objects; groups of objects (region) and the State en block; which would provide security level quantitative indicators as well as the ability to make decisions for the complex InformationSecurity  at the “Enterprise - Region - State{”} levels management. Method. The method of this research is based on the idea that the State protection level depends on the subordinate regions protection level; which in its turn; depends on the subordinate local objects (enterprise) protection level. The enterprise protection level depends on the violation of at least one of the criteria: integrity; availability; confidentiality. Results. The task of developing of the generalized model for complex InformationSecurity  of the multi-level socio-technical system evaluation in terms of “Enterprise - Region - State{”} is solved; which allows obtaining an protection level estimation of the both local (enterprise) and integrated (region and the State) objects. The probabilistic or expert evaluations in the form of fuzzy sets can be used for base threat occurrence estimation. The structural model of multi-level information-analytic center of the complex ISM  is proposed. The results of researching have shown the possibility of using this approach for estimation and management problem solution of ISM  for complex InformationSecurity  of the multi-level socio-technical systems. Conclusions. Scientific novelty of the research is in the fact that the complex InformationSecurity  at the “Enterprise - Region - State{”} management levels evaluation model is proposed for the first time.

Using the opportunity presented by neuroimaging tools to examine cognitive and affective reactions to fear appeals; we take a comparative look at the contentions of fear appeal theory and the realities of what insiders experience neurologically when exposed to ecologically relevant IS security fear appeals. Our fMRI results suggest that fear appeals elicit threat and threat response assessments; which partially supports fear appeal theory but does not support the presence of an actual fear response. Furthermore; appraisals of recommended threat responses had a stronger impact on intentions to enact security behaviors than appraisals of the threat itself; which suggests that a focus on threats might be misplaced. Instead; focusing on ways to make the responses to the threats more appealing to users might work better.

Operations management is a mediation between; first; the strategic planning and the guidance of work; and second; the different functions of an organizations reporting; in which every activity area can be systematically checked. The key idea is to have the organization managing in the whole InformationSecurity  operation be a positive management of change. To be a viable part of operations management; the ISM  is resourced and supported in all enterprise levels by decisions at the top level. There are three types of operations management. The first; structural operations management; deals with restructuring and systemizing important areas such as management features. The second; resource information operations management; is based on the real-time registered information of selected organizations. And for the third; events reporting operations management; it is essential to actively report the organizations successes and; therefore; the knowledge of their utilization. Also; there are the three main types of management decision making and control processes; which are strategic planning; management control; and work control. Strategic planning contains the organizations overall strategies; goals; and change. Under management control; consistent results will be monitored to ensure the effectiveness of the organizations resources and the achievement of objectives. Work control directs attention to the daily performance of the functions. All of these actions can be linked to the plans and objectives of the higher performance of the organization. The main contribution of this study is based on the conceptual approach; which intends to construct systems of conceptions. The research has been done to combine previously presented dimensions of management and to develop a framework process for operations management which is useful for the actions of InformationSecurity  at different enterprise levels.',2010,'2018-11-29 12:58:02','2018-11-29 12:58:02',,'160–167',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,'Demergis; J',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: After the development of 12 hypotheses; a quantitative; cross-sectional; self-administered survey method was applied to collect data in 9 hospitals in Iran. After the collection of 382 usable questionnaires; the partial least square structural modeling was applied to examine the hypotheses and it was found that 11 hypotheses were empirically supported. Results: The results suggest that patients trust in hospitals can significantly predict their perceived security but no significant associations were found between patients physical protection mechanisms in the hospital and their perceived InformationSecurity  in a hospital. We also found that patients perceptions about the physical protection mechanism of a hospital can significantly predict their trust in hospitals which is a novel finding by this research.

The globalization trends encompassing all businesses; and risks of information leakage forces organizations to institute mechanisms to protect it. In order to achieve adequate level of protection; organizations implement  ISM . The effectiveness of ISMS depends on the implementation strength of security controls. Several studies have detailed out the qualitative nature of InformationSecurity  measurements and quantitative studies have always remained a challenge. This empirical study focuses on the InformationSecurity  perceptions of internal users of the organization on the security controls; customer influence and the support provided by the top management. The perception of internal users referred as perceived InformationSecurity  is measured based on the degree of confidence expressed by the internal users towards the security objectives namely; confidentiality; integrity; availability; accountability and reliability. In an attempt to align the interest of researchers and practitioners; the study surveys major developments in the field of ISMS and proposes a construct for a holistic comprehension of ‘Perceived InformationSecurity .

Further; analyzes are conducted of the relationship between white-collar workers perceptions of the culture of their organizations and value conflicts involving InformationSecurity . Design/methodology/approach Descriptive analyses and regression analyses were conducted on survey data gathered among two samples of white-collar workers in Sweden. Findings Value conflicts regarding InformationSecurity  occur regularly among white-collar workers in the private and public sectors and within different business sectors. Variations in their occurrence can be understood partly as a function of employees work situations and the sensitivity of the information handled in the organization. Regarding how perceived organizational culture affects the occurrence of value conflicts; multivariate regression analysis reveals that employees who perceive their organizations as having externally oriented; flexible cultures experience value conflicts more often. Research limitations/implications The relatively low share of explained variance in the explanatory models indicates the need to identify alternative explanations of the occurrence of value conflicts regarding InformationSecurity . Practical implications InformationSecurity  managers need to recognize that value conflicts occur regularly among white-collar workers in different business sectors; more often among workers in organizations that handle sensitive information; and most often among white-collar workers who perceive the cultures of their organizations as being externally oriented and flexible. Originality/value The study addresses a gap in the InformationSecurity  literature by contributing to the understanding of value conflicts between InformationSecurity  and other organizational values.

A comprehensive defense strategy against such attacks should include: (1) an attack detection component that determines the fact that a system is compromised; (2) an attack identification and prevention component that identifies attack packets so that one can block such packets in the future and prevent the attack from further propagation. Over the last decade; significant research time has been invested in systems that can detect cyber attacks; either statically at compile time; or dynamically at run time. However; not much effort has been spent on automated attack packet identification or attack prevention. In this paper; we present a unified solution to these problems. We implemented this solution after reverse engineering an Open Source SecurityInformation Management (OSSIM) system; called Preventive ISM  (PrISM) system; which correlates input from different sensors so that the resulting product can automatically detect any cyber attack against it; and prevent attack by identifying the actual attack packet(s).

However; with the absence of standardized cost calculation methods; the task of quantifying the internal costs of security breaches as well as the costs of managing them is one of the difficulties of security risk analysis. Due to the fact that companies consider the time spent by employees during the reparation process of an affected InformationTechnology resource as idle; overestimations of the costs of security breaches and lost productivity; represented by the system downtime from employees perception; occur. For these reasons; this study suggests a new approach for measuring the negative economic impact associated with such security attack events. This study proposes a method which assumes that alternative tasks that do not rely on the affected InformationTechnology resource are performed; hence; the employees time is not considered as completely idle and consequently the total costs decrease.

The results of the calculations   indicate a close relationship of the parameters gain; launched pump   power; waveguide length; and Yb3+ concentration. Codoping with a   well-chosen Yb3+ concentration is shown to increase the gain around 1530   nm for all combinations of these parameters. The gain is improved most   by Yb3+ codoping at pump powers around the amplifier threshold. At high   pump powers the increase in gain of an Er3+/Yb3+ doped waveguide is   insignificant compared to that of its Er3+ doped counterpart.

Hence; given the scale and complexity of current SCADA systems; there is a need for organisations to be able to model and review the risks emanating from the propagation of identifiable vulnerabilities in IPv6 prior to actual operational deployment.

The S3MS approach presented here is a practical approach of implementing InformationTechnologySM and ISM in a consolidated and integrated way. It is driven by the methodology and requirements provided by the above mentioned standards and frameworks; but it complements them by offering a wide set of templates and samples that can be re-used; instantiated and/or refined to generate what is needed to deploy an effective documented service and security management system. Therefore; the S3MS framework is divided into a service module; a security module and a general management system module - all of which are fully aligned to each other. S3MS is the outcome from merging scientific/academic work with practical experiences and lessons learned in various InformationTechnologySM- and ISM-related projects in industry and in the public service sector.

An important problem within this context from a vendors perspective is to determine how to release patches to fix vulnerabilities in its software. From a firms perspective; the issue is how to update vulnerable systems with available patches. In this paper; we develop a game-theoretic model to study the strategic interaction between a vendor and a firm in balancing the costs and benefits of patch management. Our objective is to examine the consequences of time-driven release and update policies.We first study a centralized system in a benchmark scenario to find the socially optimal time-driven patch management. We show that the social loss is minimized when patch-release and update cycles are synchronized. Next; we consider a decentralized system in which the vendor determines its patch-release policy and the firm selects its patch-update policy in a Stackelberg framework; assuming that release and update policies are either time driven or event driven. We develop a sufficient condition that guarantees that a time-driven release by the vendor and a time-driven update by the firm is the equilibrium outcome for patch management. However; in this equilibrium; the patch-update cycle of the firm may not be synchronized with the patch-release cycle of the vendor; making it impossible to achieve the socially optimal patch management in the decentralized system. Therefore; we next examine cost sharing and liability as possible coordination mechanisms. Our analysis shows that cost sharing itself may achieve synchronization and social optimality. However; liability by itself cannot achieve social optimality unless patch-release and update cycles are already synchronized without introducing any liability. Our results also demonstrate that cost sharing and liability neither complement nor substitute each other. Finally; we show that an incentive-compatible contract on cost sharing can be designed to achieve coordination in case of information asymmetry.',2008,'2018-11-29 12:59:04','2018-11-29 12:59:04',,'657–670',,4,54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,'PMID: 31629939',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Researchers (Chang and Lin; 2007) suggest that most InformationSecurity  problems are as a result of negligent behaviour rather than attack events. The mobile phone has become a necessity for many students but; at the same time; it exposes them to security threats that may result in a loss of information. Students in developing countries are at a disadvantage because they have limited access to information relating to InformationSecurity  threats; unlike their counterparts in more developed societies who can readily access this information from sources like the Internet. The developmental environment is plagued with challenges like access to the Internet or limited access to computers. The poor security behaviour exhibited by student mobile phone users; which was confirmed by the findings of this study; is of particular interest in the university context as most undergraduate students are offered a computer-related course which covers certain InformationSecurity -related principles. Muyinda (2007) suggests that existing learning theories can be enhanced by using new practices. Student InformationSecurity  culture is the resultant outcome of InformationSecurity  related behaviours. It is based on the decisions made by student mobile phone users when faced with InformationSecurity  related choices.

For this purpose; semantic wikis have proved their strength as a flexible collaboration and knowledge sharing platforms. However; there has not been notable academic research on how semantic wikis could be used as ISM  platform in organizations for improved cyber resilience. In this paper; we propose to use semantic wiki as an agile ISM  platform. More precisely; the wiki contents are based on the structured model of the NIST Special Publication 800-53 InformationSecurity  control catalogue that is extended in the research with the additional properties that support the ISM  and especially the security control implementation. We present common uses cases to manage the InformationSecurity  in organizations and how the use cases can be implemented using the semantic wiki platform. As organizations seek cyber resilience; where focus is in the availability of cyber-related assets and services; we extend the control selection with option to focus on availability. The results of the study show that a semantic wiki based ISM  and collaboration platform can provide a cost-efficient solution for improved cyber resilience; especially for small and medium sized organizations that struggle to develop InformationSecurity  with the limited resources.

The   bureaucracy arises largely as a result of misinterpretation of the   standard and results from poor ISM  process   design and the use of inappropriate language in the risk assessment   phase. ISO 27001 mandates the implementation of the following   ISM  processes: risk assessment; risk   treatment; management review; internal audit; training and awareness;   and incident management. However; in a SME these processes can be   combined in a number of different ways to reduce the bureaucratic   overhead and yet still construct an ISO 27001 compliant management   system. The bureaucratic burden can be further reduced by tight   implementation within the existing business processes. In particular;   the bureaucracy of risk assessment can be reduced in two ways: by using   linguistic metaphors appropriate for SMEs instead of the specialist   language that is traditionally employed for InformationSecurity  risk   assessment; and by combining risk assessment with a reflexive management   review process. This paper presents a number of models for combining   ISM  processes and provides a number of case   studies to show how these combined ISM    processes can be implemented within standard business processes.

For the same period; information about the number of granted patents; petty patents; trademarks and industrial designs in Turkey were also collected. The information was analyzed by year; industrial property right type and ISO standard. A Spearman correlation analysis was also conducted to determine the strength of association between the number of certification documents and the number of granted industrial property rights. The analysis showed that some of the ISO standards had either a positive or negative linear relationship with one or more of the granted industrial property right types. Although the total number of certification documents had decreased over the time period of the study; the number of granted industrial property rights in Turkey had increased over the same period indicating that the adoption of quality managment system standards may have led to an increase in national innovation in Turkey.

Design/Methodology/approach – We used an event studies based approach where a measure of the events economic impact can be constructed using security prices observed over a relatively short period of time. Findings – Based on the results; we argue that although no strong conclusions could be made given the current data constraints; there was enough evidence to show that such correlation exists; especially for recurring security breaches. Research limitations/implications – One of the main limitations of this study was the quantity and quality of published data on security breaches; as organisations tend not to share this information. Practical implications – One of the challenges in ISM  is assessing the wider economic impact of security breaches. Subsequently; this helps drive investment decisions on security programmes that are usually seen as cost rather than moneymaking initiatives. Originality/value – We envisage that as more breach event data become more widely available due to compliance and regulatory changes; this approach has the potential to emerge as an important tool for InformationSecurity  managers to help support investment decisions.

This is a particularly important concern for knowledge-intensive organisations; such as universities; as the effective conduct of their core teaching and research activities is becoming ever more reliant on the availability; integrity and accuracy of computer-based information resources. One increasingly important mechanism for reducing the occurrence of security breaches; and in so doing; protecting corporate information; is through the formulation and application of a formal InformationSecurity  policy (InSPy). Whilst a great deal has now been written about the importance and role of the InformationSecurity  policy; and approaches to its formulation and dissemination; there is relatively little empirical material that explicitly addresses the structure or content of security policies. The broad aim of the study; reported in this paper; is to fill this gap in the literature by critically examining the structure and content of authentic InformationSecurity  policies; rather than simply making general prescriptions about what they ought to contain. Having established the structure and key features of the reviewed policies; the paper critically explores the underlying conceptualisation of InformationSecurity  embedded in the policies. There are two important conclusions to be drawn from this study: (1) the wide diversity of disparate policies and standards in use is unlikely to foster a coherent approach to security management; and (2) the range of specific issues explicitly covered in university policies is surprisingly low; and reflects a highly techno-centric view of ISM .

Currently; no feedback mechanisms are in place to evaluate   the effectiveness or economic impacts of static or dynamic policy   implementation. Here; we address the requirement for feedback and   present a policy for the next generation. This is a policy that includes   a dynamic feedback response to the effectiveness of changes. The   structure of this new type of policy; called a management system; is   borrowed from discrete event system theory and functions as a control   loop. A management system consists of four elements (control system;   sensor; controller; and actuator) that are involved in a control law. In   this article; we present also an analytical description of the optimal   structure through which the three management systems (Information   Security Management System (ISMS); Business Continuity Management   System; and InformationTechnology Service Management) should be linked in a company. We   define a coupling parameter and; using an equation for the discrete   control loop; show that ISMS and InformationTechnology Service Management should ideally be   strongly coupled; and ISMS and Business Continuity Management System   should be weakly coupled. Furthermore; two types of management system   can be defined. A simple management system (1 st order management   system) responds to and regulates only perturbations. An advanced   management system (2 nd order management system) has an overarching   target function that influences the controller. This target function is   usually economically oriented.

This paper evaluates if an  ISM  (ISMS); defined by the international standard ISO/IEC 27001 and 27002 can be used to comprehensively support InformationSecurity  governance for SOA. As SOA governance; a separate and distinct governance framework; also addresses InformationSecurity  to a certain extent; managers are faced the difficult task of deciding whether their SOA sufficiently protected by the different frameworks. The conclusion is that InformationSecurity  for SOA needs to be addressed more holistically; following an Enterprise InformationSecurity  Architecture (EISA) approach where Enterprise Architecture (EA) is concerned with the design of the overall architectural vision of an organization. The framework chosen for this purpose is SABSA; a well-known enterprise security architecture. Using the example of access control to highlight challenges; it becomes clear that InformationSecurity  governance for SOA can benefit from an approach such as SABSA.

Threat profiling allows analysts to understand and organize intelligent information related to threat groups. This paper presents a comparative analysis that was conducted to study the existing threat profiling models. It was found that existing threat models were constructed based on specific objectives; thus each model is limited to only certain components or factors such as assets; threat sources; countermeasures; threat agents; threat outcomes and threat actors. It is suggested that threat profiling can be improved by the combination of components found in each existing threat profiling model/framework.

While researches about the anti-virus policy have been extensively investigated; the viewpoint from sociological perspective is relatively ignored. Therefore; this paper aims to explore the dynamics of computer-virus propagation and evaluate the effectiveness of anti-virus policies through the sociological perspective. Design/methodology/approach – This research constructs a virus-propagation model based on the susceptible-exposed-infective-recovered epidemic concept to simulate and explore the dynamic behavior of multipartite computer viruses through the tool of system dynamics. The effectiveness of various anti-virus policies is then evaluated via this model. Findings – The frequency of media contact has a significant effect on the virus infection rate. The effectiveness of user self-prevention relies on the usefulness of the virus signatures. The reporting/alarm process can enhance the capability of anti-virus software company and the detected intensity of new threat. The quarantine policy can effectively reduce the spread of computer virus. Practical implications – Individuals should strengthen the self-awareness of InformationSecurity  to reduce the negative impact. Managers should construct and implement the InformationSecurity  norm to regulate the behavior of staff. Anti-virus software companies should strengthen the capability of their automatic reporting/alarm mechanism to early detect the exceptional conditions and control new threats in time. Originality/value – ISM  research is still in the growth phase; but it is critically important to establish the groundwork for understanding of computer viruses and the effectiveness of anti-virus policy from assorted perspectives. The major contribution of research is to explore the propagation of multipartite computer viruses and study how to prevent their destruction from the sociological and technical perspectives.',2014,'2018-11-29 13:00:31','2018-11-29 13:00:31',,'86–106',,1,114,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,'ISM ; Anti-virus policy; Multipartite computer-virus propagation; SEIR model; System dynamics',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While increasing incidents of InformationSecurity  breaches have generated extensive publicity; previous studies repeatedly expose low levels of managerial awareness and commitment; a key obstacle to achieving a good InformationSecurity  posture. The main motivation of our study emanates from this phenomenon that the increased vulnerability to InformationSecurity  breaches is coupled with the low level of managerial awareness and commitment regarding InformationSecurity  threats. We report this dissonance by addressing a cognitive bias called optimistic bias. Using a survey; we study if MIS executives are subject to such a bias in their vulnerability perceptions of InformationSecurity . We find that they demonstrate optimistic bias in risk perception on InformationSecurity  domain. The extent of this optimistic bias is greater with a distant comparison target with fewer information sharing activities. This optimistic bias is also found to be related to perception of controllability with InformationSecurity  threats. In order to overcome the effects of optimistic bias; firms need more security awareness training and systematic treatments of security threats instead of relying on ad hoc approach to security measure implementation.

Hence a secure organizational environment is one that is characterized by stability and social order; which is a result of negotiations and alignment of interests among different actants. The argument is conducted through a case study. Our findings reveal not only the usefulness of ANT in developing an understanding of the (in)security environment at the case study organization; but also the ability of ANT to identify differences in interests among actants.

Design/methodology/approach The study is conducted using survey data among (n = 674) Swedish white-collar workers. Statistical analyses are conducted to explore variations in acceptance of whistleblowing and analyse the relationship between acceptance for whistleblowing and InformationSecurity  attitudes and behaviours. Findings The study finds strong support for whistleblowing in both public and private spheres; and by both private and public sector employees. The study also finds stronger acceptance for intra- organizational whistleblowing; while support for external whistleblowing is low. Finally; the study shows that the whistleblowing activities might be perceived as coming in conflict with InformationSecurity  work; even as the support for including whistleblowing functions in InformationSecurity  practices is high. Research limitations/implications With a focus on one country; the study is limited in terms of empirical scope. It is also limited by a relatively small number of respondents and survey items relating to whistleblowing; which in turn affects its explanatory value. However; the study does provide unique new insight into a specific form of non-compliance; i.e. whistleblowing; which merits further investigation. Originality/value Few studies exist that combine insights from the fields of whistleblowing and InformationSecurity  research. Thus; this study provides a basis for further investigation into attitudes and behaviours linked to whistleblowing in public and private organisations; as well as attendant value conflicts related to ISM  and practice.',2018,'2018-11-29 13:00:44','2018-11-29 13:00:44',,'246–258',,2,26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We propose a different theoretical model: the value-based compliance model; assuming that multiple forms of rationality are employed in organizational actions at one time; causing potential value conflicts. This has strong strategic implications for the management of InformationSecurity . We believe health care situations can be better managed using the assumptions of a value-based compliance model.

Absorption bands in the spectra of the triclinic form are singlets. Extensive doubling of bands occurs for the mono clinic and orthorhombic structures in accordance with selection rules based on the factor group symmetry. In particular; the methylene rocking mode bands of the orthorhombic structure display a striking pattern of splitting. Frequency separations of the components can be expressed by a simple function of a single parameter; k? (m + 1); where m is the number of methylene groups of the n-paraffin and k is an integer which characterizes a particular intramolecular mode. From these data several intermolecular force constants have been evaluated. In relating these force constants to specific methylene interactions; methylenes in adjacent planes were found to interact more strongly than those in the same plane. By extending Steins theory that the splitting arises from short range repulsive forces; to include additional interactions; the force constants are explained satisfactorily. However; interactions which involve only dipole-dipole forces are found to be inadequate.

This paper assesses the effectiveness of depending on vulnerability scanners in the  ISM . It compares between four of the leading vulnerability scanners in the market and carries out a study of their effectiveness in detecting missed patches. The results show the severity of relying on vulnerability scanners to discover system patches status. A number of false positive and false negative detections for the system patches are reported by each of the tested scanners. The severe level for some of the unreported missed patches ranked as critical that puts the system in a high risk and makes it vulnerable for different attacks.',2013,'2018-11-29 13:00:48','2018-11-29 13:00:48',,'185–195',,,381,,,,'Communications in Computer and Information Science',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,'Awad; AI and Hassanien; AE and Baba; K',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We develop an analytical model in which a variety of factors are balanced to best manage the detection component within ISM . The approach not only considers conventional factors such as detection rate and false-positive rate; but also factors associated with hacker behavior that occur in response to improvements in the detection system made by the firm. Detection can be improved by increasing the systems discrimination ability (i.e.; the ability to distinguish between attacks and normal usage) through the application of maintenance effort. The discrimination ability deteriorates over time due to changes in the environment. Also; there is the possibility of sudden shocks that can sharply degrade the discrimination ability. The firms cost increases as hackers become more knowledgeable by disseminating security knowledge within the hacker population. The problem is solved to reveal the presence of a steady-state solution in which the level of system discrimination ability and maintenance effort are held constant. We find an interesting result where; under certain conditions; hackers do not benefit from disseminating security knowledge among one another. In other situations; we find that hackers benefit because the firm must lower its detection rate in the presence of knowledge dissemination. Other insights into managing detection systems are provided. For example; the presence of security shocks can increase or decrease the optimal discrimination level as compared to the optimal level without shocks.',2011,'2018-11-29 13:00:50','2018-11-29 13:00:50',,'606–623',,3,22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,'PMID: 65959125',,,,'Hacker learning; Optimal security management; Security shocks; Variable attack rates',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This research employs social network analysis methods to explore why the employees are willing to share InformationSecurity  advice; as well as examines the structural patterns of this sharing network. We found favourable security attitude and engagement in daily activities have positive impacts on security advice sharing; whereas perceiving too much social pressure makes the employees deliberately refuse to share security advice. We also found security advice sharing is transitive and non-reciprocal; and there are a few dominant employees who control the flow of security advice.
